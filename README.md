Congressional App Challenge Product for 2020

Congressional App Challenge:
	Three friends and I recently submitted an iOS application for the 2020 Congressional App Challenge, for which we placed third in Ohio's 10th Congressional District. 
	Our application, “text&teach,” provides teachers and other educators with a supportive virtual environment for exchanging ideas. Within the applications, teachers can register for an account to view discussion topics and contribute to discussions on a user-friendly interface. They can also create their own discussions based on pressing questions they may have, asking for ideas from other teachers and users.
	We created this app because we feel as if teachers would benefit from having a designated and portable communication platform, especially during the age of COVID-19. Our goal is to turn “text&teach” into a platform used not just by one school, but by many school districts across the nation.
